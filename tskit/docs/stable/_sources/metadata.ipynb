    "from a VCF INFO field, or administrative information (such as unique identifiers)\n",

    "As the underlying metadata is in raw binary (see\n",
    "{ref}`data model <sec_metadata_definition>`) it\n",
    "must be encoded and decoded. The C API does not do this, but the Python API will\n",
    "use the schema to decode the metadata to Python objects.\n",
    "The encoding for doing this is specified in the top-level schema property `codec`.\n",
    "Currently the Python API supports the `json` codec which encodes metadata as\n",
    "[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), and the `struct` codec which encodes\n",
    "metadata in an efficient schema-defined binary format using {func}`python:struct.pack` .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "When `json` is specified as the `codec` in the schema the metadata is encoded in\n",
    "the human readable [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. As this format\n",
    "is human readable and encodes numbers as text it uses more bytes than the `struct`\n",
    "format. However it is simpler to configure as it doesn't require any format specifier\n",
    "for each type in the schema. Default values for properties can be specified for only\n",
    "the shallowest level of the metadata object. Tskit deviates from standard JSON in that\n",
    "empty metadata is interpreted as an empty object. This is to allow setting of a schema\n",
    "to a table with out the need to modify all existing empty rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### struct\n",
    "\n",
    "When `struct` is specifed as the `codec` in the schema the metadata is encoded\n",
    "using {func}`python:struct.pack` which results in a compact binary representation which\n",
    "is much smaller and generally faster to encode/decode than JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "This codec places extra restrictions on the schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each property must have a `binaryFormat`\n",
    "    This sets the binary encoding used for the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All metadata objects must have fixed properties.\n",
    "    This means that additional properties not listed in the schema are disallowed. Any\n",
    "    property that does not have a `default` specified in the schema must be present.\n",
    "    Default values will be encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arrays must be lists of homogeneous objects.\n",
    "    For example, this is not valid:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": [{\"type\": \"number\"}, {\"type\": \"string\"}]}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Types must be singular and not unions.\n",
    "    For example, this is not valid:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    {\"type\": [\"number\", \"string\"]}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    One exception is that the top-level can be a union of `object` and `null` to\n",
    "    support the case where some rows do not have metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The order that properties are encoded is by default alphabetically by name.\n",
    "    The order can be overridden by setting an optional numerical `index` on each\n",
    "    property. This is due to objects being unordered in JSON and Python `dicts`.\n",
