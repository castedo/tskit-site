    "   ```bash\n",
    "   $ git fetch upstream pull/854/head:my_pr_copy\n",

    "   You should probably call the branch something more descriptive,\n",

    "\n",
    "### Error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical element of producing reliable C programs is consistent error handling\n",
    "and checking of return values. All return values **must** be checked! In tskit,\n",
    "all functions (except the most trivial accessors) return an integer to indicate\n",
    "success or failure. Any negative value is an error, and must be handled accordingly.\n",
    "The following pattern is canonical:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "   ret = tsk_tree_do_something(self, argument);\n",
    "    if (ret != 0) {\n",
    "        goto out;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // rest of function\n",
    "out:\n",
    "    return ret;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we test the return value of `tsk_tree_do_something` and if it is non-zero,\n",
    "abort the function and return this same value from the current function. This\n",
    "is a bit like throwing an exception in higher-level languages, but discipline\n",
    "is required to ensure that the error codes are propagated back to the original\n",
    "caller correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particular care must be taken in functions that allocate memory, because\n",
    "we must ensure that this memory is freed in all possible success and\n",
    "failure scenarios. The following pattern is used throughout for this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "    double *x = NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = malloc(n * sizeof(double));\n",
    "    if (x == NULL) {\n",
    "        ret = TSK_ERR_NO_MEMORY;\n",
    "        goto out;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // rest of function\n",
    "out:\n",
    "    tsk_safe_free(x);\n",
    "    return ret;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is vital here that `x` is initialised to `NULL` so that we are guaranteed\n",
    "correct behaviour in all cases. For this reason, the convention is to declare all\n",
    "pointer variables on a single line and to initialise them to `NULL` as part\n",
    "of the declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error codes are defined in `core.h`, and these can be translated into a\n",
    "message using `tsk_strerror(err)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to express assertions in tskit code.\n",
    "The first is using the custom `tsk_bug_assert` macro, which is used to\n",
    "make inexpensive checks at key points during execution. These assertions\n",
    "are always run, regardless of the compiler settings, and should not\n",
    "contribute significantly to the overall runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "More expensive assertions, used, for example, to check pre and post conditions\n",
    "on performance critical loops should be expressed using the standard\n",
    "`assert` macro from `assert.h`. These assertions will be checked\n",
    "during the execution of C unit tests, but will not be enabled when\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python C interface is defined in the `python` directory\n",
    "and written using the [Python C API](https://docs.python.org/3.6/c-api/).\n",
    "The source code for this interface is in the `_tskitmodule.c` file.\n",
    "When compiled, this produces the `_tskit` module,\n",
    "which is imported by the high-level Python code. The low-level Python module is\n",
    "not intended to be used directly by users and may change arbitrarily over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual pattern in the low-level Python API is to define a Python class\n",
    "which corresponds to a given \"class\" in the C API. For example, we define\n",
    "a `TreeSequence` class, which is essentially a thin wrapper around the\n",
    "`tsk_tree_t` type from the C library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_tskitmodule.c` file follows the standard conventions given in the\n",
    "[Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/extending/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling and debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setup.py` file describes the requirements for the low-level `_tskit`\n",
    "module and how it is built from source. The simplest way to compile the\n",
    "low-level module is to run `make` in the `python` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `make` is not available, you can run the same command manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes useful to specify compiler flags when building the low\n",
    "level module. For example, to make a debug build you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ CFLAGS='-Wall -O0 -g' make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to track down a segfault etc, running some code through gdb can\n",
    "be very useful. For example, to run a particular test case, we can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "tskit codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this guide covers the most complex case of adding a new function to both\n",
    "the C and Python APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write your function in Python: in `python/tests/` find the test module that\n",
    "    pertains to the functionality you wish to add. For instance, the kc_distance\n",
    "    metric was added to\n",
    "    [test_topology.py](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/python/tests/test_topology.py).\n",
    "    Add a python version of your function here.\n",
    "2.  Create a new class in this module to write unit tests for your function: in addition\n",
    "    to making sure that your function is correct, make sure it fails on inappropriate inputs.\n",
    "    This can often require judgement. For instance, {meth}`Tree.kc_distance` fails on a tree\n",
    "    with multiple roots, but allows users to input parameter values that are nonsensical,\n",
    "    as long as they don't break functionality. See the\n",
    "    [TestKCMetric](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/4e707ea04adca256036669cd852656a08ec45590/python/tests/test_topology.py#L293) for example.\n",
    "3.  Write your function in C: check out the {ref}`sec_c_api` for guidance. There\n",
    "    are also many examples in the\n",
    "    [c directory](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/tree/main/c/tskit).\n",
    "    Your function will probably go in\n",
    "    [trees.c](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/c/tskit/trees.c).\n",
    "4.  Write a few tests for your function in C: again, write your tests in\n",
    "    [tskit/c/tests/test_tree.c](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/c/tests/test_trees.c).\n",
    "    The key here is code coverage, you don't need to worry as much about covering every\n",
    "    corner case, as we will proceed to link this function to the Python tests you\n",
    "    wrote earlier.\n",
    "5.  Create a low-level definition of your function using Python's C API: this will\n",
    "    go in [_tskitmodule.c](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/python/_tskitmodule.c).\n",
    "6.  Test your low-level implementation in [tskit/python/tests/test_lowlevel.py\n",
    "   ](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/python/tests/test_lowlevel.py):\n",
    "    again, these tests don't need to be as comprehensive as your first python tests,\n",
    "    instead, they should focus on the interface, e.g., does the function behave\n",
    "    correctly on malformed inputs?\n",
    "7.  Link your C function to the Python API: write a function in tskit's Python API,\n",
    "    for example the kc_distance function lives in\n",
    "    [tskit/python/tskit/trees.py](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/python/tskit/trees.py).\n",
    "8.  Modify your Python tests to test the new C-linked function: if you followed\n",
    "    the example of other tests, you might need to only add a single line of code\n",
    "    here. In this case, the tests are well factored so that we can easily compare\n",
    "    the results from both the Python and C versions.\n",
    "9.  Write a docstring for your function in the Python API: for instance, the kc_distance\n",
    "    docstring is in\n",
    "    [tskit/python/tskit/trees.py](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/blob/main/python/tskit/trees.py).\n",
    "    Ensure that your docstring renders correctly by building the documentation\n",

    "### pre-commit is blocking me!\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be having a hard time committing because of the \"pre-commit\" checks\n",
    "(described above). First, consider: the pre-commit hooks are supposed to make your life *easier*,\n",
    "not add a layer of frustration to contributing.\n",
    "So, you should feel free to just ask git to skip the pre-commit!\n",
    "There's no shame in a broken build - you can get it fixed up (and we'll help)\n",
    "before it's merged into the rest of the project.\n",
    "To skip, just append `--no-verify` to the `git commit` command.\n",
    "Below are some more specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### pre-commit complains about files I didn't edit\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose you have *not* edited `util.py` and yet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> git commit -a -m 'dev docs'\n",
    "python/tskit/util.py:117:26: E203 whitespace before ':'\n",

    "... lots more, gah, what is this ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check (with `git status`) that you didn't actually edit `util.py`.\n",
    "Then, you should **not** try to fix these errors; this is **not your problem**.\n",
    "You might first try restarting your pre-commit, by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pre-commit clean\n",
    "pre-commit gc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also check you don't have other pre-commit hook files in `.git/hooks`.\n",
    "If this doesn't fix the problem,\n",
    "then you should just *skip* the pre-commit (but alert us to the problem),\n",
    "by appending `--no-verify`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> git commit -a -m 'dev docs' --no-verify\n",
    "[main 46f3f2e] dev docs\n",

    "\n",
    "What the heck? Why is this even looking for python3.7?\n",
    "This is because of the \"pre-commit hook\", mentioned above.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "[main 99a01da] fixed all the things\n",

    "We'll help you sort it out in the PR.\n",

    "Tskit has a simple benchmarking tool to help keep track of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark suite can be run with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> cd python/benchmark\n",
    "> python run.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of benchmarks can be run by specifying a string. For example, the following command runs all the benchmarks whose names contain \"genotype\", e.g. \"genotype_matrix\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> python run.py -k genotype\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If desired, the results of the benchmarks can be printed to STDOUT.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> python run.py -k genotype -p\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are written to `bench-results.json` in the same folder. Note that if any version of `tskit`\n",
    "is installed then that will be used for the benchmarking. To use the local development version of\n",
    "tskit ensure you have `pip uninstall tskit` before running the benchmarking. The version used is\n",
    "shown in the header of the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a new benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmarks are specified by the `config.yaml` file in `python/benchmark`. To add a new benchmark \n",
    "add an entry to the `benchmarks` dictionary. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  - code: do_my_thing({option_name})\n",
    "    setup: |\n",
    "      import a_module\n",

    "        - \"reticulate_splines\"\n",
    "        - \"foobar\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are interpreted as Python f-strings, so you can use the `parameters` dictionary to provide\n",
    "values that will be interpolated into both the `setup` and `code` strings.\n",
