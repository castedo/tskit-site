Continuing on from the 2018 PLOS Computational Biology paper,
we discuss here how the tree
sequence recording method was implemented in the powerful
[SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) simulator. We
show how some simulations are orders of magnitude more efficient
and examples of the new possibilities that keeping a full
record of the genetic ancestry makes available.
