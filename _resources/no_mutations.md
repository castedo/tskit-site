title: Do you really need mutations?
---
In tree sequences, the genetic genealogy exists independently of the mutations that generate genetic variation, and often we are primarily interested in genetic variation because of what it can tell us about those genealogies. This tutorial aims to illustrate when we can leave mutations and genetic variation aside and study the genealogies directly.
