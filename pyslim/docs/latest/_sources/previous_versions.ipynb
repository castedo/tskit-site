    "# Migrating from previous versions of pyslim\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyslim 1.0 release coincides with that of SLiM v4,\n",
    "which introduced a number of changes to SLiM.\n",
    "pyslim remains backwards compatible, in that pyslim 1.0\n",
    "will happily read tree sequences produced by previous versions of SLiM or pyslim,\n",
    "and will convert them to the current version.\n",
    "However, previous pyslim code may not work, due to two sets of changes:\n",
    "(1) much of the functionality originally in pyslim has moved to tskit\n",
    "(e.g., metadata processing), and (2) minor changes to terminology in SLiM v4\n",
    "(\"generation\" is now \"tick\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting previous code should be straightforward, as there are exact replacements.\n",
    "The most important changes are to remove calls to `pyslim.load( )` or `SlimTreeSequence( )`,\n",
    "and change \"generation=\" arguments to \"tick=\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, to upgrade code you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change `pyslim.load( )` to `tskit.load( )`.\n",
    "2. Remove calls to `SlimTreeSequence( )`. They are not needed.\n",
    "3. Change `generation` to `tick` in any arguments to functions, or in metadata.\n",
    "4. Change `pyslim.annotate_defaults( )` to `pyslim.annotate( )`.\n",
    "    and `pyslim.annotate_defaults_tables( )` to `pyslim.annotate_tables( )`.\n",
    "5. Change `pyslim.update_tables( )` to `pyslim.update( )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some methods of SlimTreeSequence are now methods of pyslim that take a tree sequence\n",
    "as their first argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Change `ts.recapitate(...)` to `pyslim.recapitate(ts, ...)`.\n",
    "7. Change `ts.individuals_alive_at(t)` to `pyslim.individuals_alive_at(ts, t)`.\n",
    "8. Change `ts.has_individual_parents()` to `pyslim.has_individual_parents(ts)`,\n",
    "    and `ts.individual_parents()` to `pyslim.individual_parents(ts)`.\n",
    "9. Replace `ts.first_generation_individuals()` with\n",
    "    an appropriate call to `pyslim.individuals_alive_at( )`.\n",
    "10. Change `ts.mutation_at(...)` to `pyslim.mutation_at(ts, ...)`.\n",
    "    and `ts.nucleotide_at(...)` to `pyslim.nucleotide_at(ts, ...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several properties previously provided by SlimTreeSequence are now provided\n",
    "by TreeSequence (e.g., `ts.individual_times`); so these need no change.\n",
    "However, these were briefly available as pyslim methods, so would need changing:\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Change `pyslim.individual_times(ts)` to `ts.individuals_time`,\n",
    "    `pyslim.individual_populations(ts)` to `ts.individuals_population`, and\n",
    "    `pyslim.individual_locations(ts)` to `ts.individuals_location`\n",
    "\n",
    "The change from `pyslim.annotate_defaults( )` to `pyslim.annotate( )`\n",
    "also entailed some small changes in behavior. Most notably,\n",
    "since msprime.sim_ancestry() now simulates individuals\n",
    "by default, annotation does not set up individuals: if you have a tree\n",
    "sequence without individuals (e.g., produced by msprime.simulate()) then you\n",
    "need to set up those individuals yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update a tree sequence produced by an old version of SLiM to the current one,\n",
    "use `pyslim.update( )`. (However, note that reading it in to SLiM and\n",
    "writing it out again might be even easier.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also see notes below for 0.700.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.700\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of features that were first introduced in pyslim have been made part of core\n",
    "tskit functionality. For instance, reference sequence support was provided (although\n",
    "loosely) inpyslim to support SLiM's nucleotide models, but is now part of a standard\n",
    "tskit {class}`tskit.TreeSequence`. Similarly, metadata processing in tskit made\n",
    "code to do this within pyslim obsolete; this \"legacy metadata\" code has been removed\n",
    "and instructions for how to migrate your code are [below](sec_legacy_metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we are now at the (very good) place where we don't really need\n",
    "the `pyslim.SlimTreeSequence` class any longer,\n",
    "and it will soon be deprecated.\n",
    "So, pyslim is migrating to be purely functional: instead of providing the SlimTreeSequence\n",
    "class with specialized methods, all methods will be functions of TreeSequences,\n",
    "that take in a tree sequence and return something\n",
    "(a modified tree sequence or some summary of it).\n",
    "Backwards compatibility will be maintained for some time, but we request that you\n",
    "switch over sooner, as your code will be cleaner and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To migrate, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace `ts.slim_generation` with `ts.metadata['SLiM']['generation']`,\n",
    "    and `ts.model_type` with `ts.metadata['SLiM']['model_type']`.\n",
    "2. Replace `ts.reference_sequence` with `ts.reference_sequence.data`.\n",
    "3. Replace calls to `ts.recapitate(...)` with `pyslim.recapitate(ts, ...)`,\n",
    "    and similarly with other SlimTreeSequence methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter difficulties, please post an\n",

    "(sec_legacy_metadata)=\n",
    "\n",
    "## Legacy metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous versions of pyslim,\n",
    "SLiM-specific metadata was provided as customized objects:\n",
    "for instance, for a node ``n`` provided by a ``SlimTreeSequence``,\n",
    "we'd have ``n.metadata`` as a ``NodeMetadata`` object,\n",
    "with attributes ``n.metadata.slim_id`` and ``n.metadata.is_null`` and ``n.metadata.genome_type``.\n",
    "However, with tskit 0.3,\n",
    "the capacity to deal with structured metadata\n",
    "was implemented in [tskit itself](tskit:sec_metadata),\n",
    "and so pyslim shifted to using the tskit-native metadata tools.\n",
    "As a result, parsed metadata is provided as a dictionary instead of an object,\n",
    "so that now ``n.metadata`` would be a dict,\n",
    "with entries ``n.metadata[\"slim_id\"]`` and ``n.metadata[\"is_null\"]`` and ``n.metadata[\"genome_type\"]``.\n",
    "Annotation should be done with tskit methods (e.g., ``packset_metadata``).\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "\n",
    "    Until pyslim version 0.600, the old-style metadata was still available,\n",
    "    but this functionality has been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are more detailed notes on how to migrate a script from the legacy\n",
    "metadata handling. If you run into issues, please ask (open a discussion on github).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Use top-level metadata instead of ``slim_provenance``:\n",
    "previously, information about the model type and the time counter (generation)\n",
    "in SLiM was provided in the Provenances table, made available through\n",
    "the ``ts.slim_provenance`` object.  This is still available but deprecated,\n",
    "and should be obtained from the *top-level* metadata object, ``ts.metadata[\"SLiM\"]``.\n",
    "So, in your scripts ``ts.slim_provenance.model_type`` should be replaced with\n",
    "``ts.metadata[\"SLiM\"][\"model_type\"]``,\n",
    "and (although it's not deprecated), probably ``ts.slim_generation`` should\n",
    "probably be replaced with\n",
    "``ts.metadata[\"SLiM\"][\"generation\"]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** Switch metadata objects to dicts:\n",
    "if ``md`` is the ``metadata`` property of a population, individual, or node,\n",
    "this means replacing ``md.X`` with ``md[\"X\"]``.\n",
    "The ``migration_records`` property of population metadata is similarly\n",
    "a list of dicts rather than a list of objects, so instead of\n",
    "``ts.population(1).metadata.migration_records[0].source_subpop``\n",
    "we would write\n",
    "``ts.population(1).metadata[\"migration_records\"][0][\"source_subpop\"]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutations were previously a bit different - if ``mut`` is a mutation\n",
    "(e.g., ``mut = ts.mutation(0)``)\n",
    "then ``mut.metadata`` was previously a list of MutationMetadata objects.\n",
    "Now, ``mut.metadata`` is a dict, with a single entry:\n",
    "``mut.metadata[\"mutation_list\"]`` is a list of dicts, each containing the information\n",
    "that was previously in the MutationMetadata objects.\n",
    "So, for instance, instead of ``mut.metadata[0].selection_coeff``\n",
    "we would write ``mut.metadata[\"mutation_list\"][0][\"selection_coeff\"]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** The ``decode_X`` and ``encode_X`` methods are now deprecated,\n",
    "as this is handled by tskit itself.\n",
    "For instance, ``encode_node`` would take a NodeMetadata object\n",
    "and produce the raw bytes necessary to encode it in a Node table,\n",
    "and ``decode_node`` would do the inverse operation.\n",
    "This is now handled by the relevant MetadataSchema object:\n",
    "for nodes one can obtain this as ``nms = ts.tables.nodes.metadata_schema``,\n",
    "which has the methods ``nms.validate_and_encode_row`` and ``nms.decode_row``.\n",
    "Decoding is for the most part not necessary,\n",
    "since the metadata is automatically decoded,\n",
    "but ``pyslim.decode_node(raw_md)`` could be replaced by ``nms.decode_row(raw_md)``.\n",
    "Encoding is necessary to modify tables,\n",
    "and ``pyslim.encode_node(md)`` can be replaced by ``nms.validate_and_encode_row(md)``\n",
    "(where furthermore ``md`` should now be a dict rather than a NodeMetadata object).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** The ``annotate_X_metadata`` methods are deprecated,\n",
    "as again tskit has tools to do this.\n",
    "These methods would set the metadata column of a table -\n",
    "for instance, if ``metadata`` is a list of NodeMetadata objects, then\n",
    "``annotate_node_metadata(tables, metadata)`` would modify ``tables.nodes`` in place\n",
    "to contain the (encoded) metadata in the list ``metadata``.\n",
    "Now, this could be done as follows (where now ``metadata`` is a list of metadata dicts):"
