    "SLiM puts SLiM-specific information into the *metadata* for the tree sequence,\n",
    "as well as for each populations, individuals, nodes and mutations.\n",
    "Here is a quick reference to what information is available:\n",
    "see the SLiM manual for the more technical writeup.\n",
    "A good way to get a generic metadata example is with {func}`.default_slim_metadata`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-level:**\n",
    "If `ts` is your tree sequence, then `ts.metadata` is a dict,\n",
    "and `ts.metadata[\"SLiM\"]` contains information about the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `file_version`: the version of the SLiM tree sequence file format\n",
    "- `tick`: the value of `community.tick` within SLiM when the file was written out\n",
    "- `cycle`: the value of `sim.cycle` within SLiM when the file was written out\n",
    "- `model_type`: either `\"WF\"` or `\"nonWF\"`\n",
    "- `nucleotide_based`: whether this is a nucleotide-based simulation\n",
    "- `separate_sexes`: whether the simulation has separate sexes or not\n",
    "- `spatial_dimensionality`: for instance, `\"\"` or `\"x\"` or `\"xy\"` (etcetera)\n",
    "- `spatial_periodicity`: whether space wraps around in some directions (same format as dimensionality)\n",
    "- `stage`: the *stage* of the life cycle at which the file was written out (either `\"first\"`, `\"early\"`, or `\"late\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Populations:**\n",
    "Information about each SLiM-produced population is written to metatadata.\n",
    "The format uses JSON and is extensible, so other keys may be present\n",
    "and some keys may be missing (for instance, there are no spatial bounds\n",
    "in a nonspatial simulation). The metadata may be `None` for populations\n",
    "that SLiM did not use. The keys that SLiM uses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `slim_id`: the ID of this population in SLiM\n",

    "- `selfing_fraction`, `female_cloning_fraction`, `male_cloning_fraction`, and `sex_ratio`: only present when applicable (e.g., in WF simulations)\n",
    "- `bounds_x0`, `bounds_x1`, `bounds_y0`, `bounds_y1`, `bounds_z0`, and `bounds_z1`: the spatial bounds, when applicable\n",

    "- `pedigree_p1`, `pedigree_p2`: the pedigree IDs of the individuals' two\n",
    "  parents (they may be equal in the case of selfing, or `-1` to indicate no\n",
    "  parent, in the case of the initial generation or for cloning)\n",
    "- `age`: the `.age` property within SLiM at the time the file was written out\n",
    "- `subpopulation`: the subpopulation within SLiM the individual was in at the time the file was written out\n",
    "- `sex`: the sex of the individual (either {data}`.INDIVIDUAL_TYPE_FEMALE`, {data}`.INDIVIDUAL_TYPE_MALE`, or {data}`.INDIVIDUAL_TYPE_HERMAPHRODITE`)\n",

    "**Nodes:**\n",
    "Each \"node\" produced by SLiM (i.e., \"genome\" within SLiM) has:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mutations:**\n",
    "Each mutation's metadata is a dictionary with a single key, `\"mutation_list\"`,\n",
    "whose entry is a *list* of metadata dictionaries corresponding to the mutations that are \"stacked\",\n",
    "i.e., all present, in all genomes inheriting from this (tskit) mutation.\n",

    "- `mutation_type`: the numeric ID of the `MutationType` within SLiM\n",
    "- `selection_coeff`: the selection coefficient\n",
    "- `subpopulation`: the numeric ID of the subpopulation the mutation occurred in\n",
    "- `slim_time`: the value of `community.tick` when the mutation occurred\n",
