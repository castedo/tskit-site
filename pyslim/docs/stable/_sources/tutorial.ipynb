    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most common pyslim operations involve [](sec_tutorial_recapitation),\n",
    "[](sec_tutorial_simplification),  and/or [](sec_tutorial_adding_neutral_mutations).\n",
    "Below we illustrate all three in the context of running a \"hybrid\" simulation, combining\n",
    "both forwards and backwards (coalescent) methods. This hybrid approach is a popular\n",
    "application of pyslim because coalescent algorithms, although more limited in the degree\n",
    "of biological realism they can attain, can be much faster than the forwards algorithms\n",
    "implemented in SLiM.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical use-case is to take an existing SLiM simulation and endow\n",
    "it with a history derived from a coalescent simulation: this is known as *recapitation*.\n",
    "For instance, suppose we have a SLiM simulation of a population of 100,000 individuals\n",
    "that we have run for 10,000 generations without neutral mutations. Now, we wish to\n",
    "extract whole-genome genotype data for only 1,000 individuals. Here's one way to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. {func}`.recapitate` :\n",
    "   The simulation has likely not reached demographic equilibrium - it has not\n",
    "   *coalesced* entirely; recapitation uses coalescent simulation to provide\n",
    "   a \"prior history\" for the initial generation of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. {meth}`simplify() <tskit.TreeSequence.simplify>` : For efficiency, subset the tree\n",
    "   sequence to only the information relevant for those 1,000 individuals\n",

    "\n",
    "3. {func}`msprime.sim_mutations` : Add neutral mutations to the tree sequence.\n",

    "#### Recapitation with a nonuniform recombination map\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we recapitated using a uniform genetic map.\n",
    "But, msprime - like SLiM - can simulate with recombination drawn from an arbitrary genetic map.\n",
    "Let's say we've already got a recombination map as specified by SLiM,\n",
    "as a vector of \"positions\" and a vector of \"rates\".\n",
    "msprime also needs vectors of positions and rates, but the format is slightly different.\n",
    "To use the SLiM values for msprime, we need to do three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a 0 at the beginning of the positions,\n",
    "2. add 1 to the last position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why msprime \"positions\" must start with 0 (step 1) is that in SLiM,\n",
    "a position or \"end\" indicates the end of a recombination block such that its associated\n",
    "\"rate\" applies to everything to the left of that end (see ``initializeRecombinationRate``).\n",
    "In msprime, we will pass in a {class}`msprime.RateMap`,\n",
    "which requires two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``position``: A list of n+1 positions, starting at 0, and ending in the sequence length over which the RateMap will apply.\n",
    "- ``rate``: A list of n positive rates that apply between each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, msprime needs a vector of positions that is 1 longer than what you give SLiM,\n",
    "but one fewer rate values than positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for step 2 is that intervals for tskit (which msprime uses)\n",
    "are \"closed on the left and open on the right\",\n",
    "which means that the genomic interval from 0.0 to 100.0 includes 0.0 but does not include 100.0.\n",
    "If SLiM has a final genomic position of 99, then it could have mutations occurring at position 99.\n",
    "Such mutations would *not* be legal, on the other hand, if we set the tskit sequence length to 99,\n",
    "since the position 99 would be outside of the interval from 0 to 99.\n",
    "Said another way, if SLiM's final position is 99, the total sequence length is 100,\n",
    "and so we need to set the end of the genome to 100.\n",
    "The upshot is that we need to use SLiM's last position plus one - i.e.,\n",
    "the length of the genome - as the rightmost coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose that we have a recombination map file in the following (tab-separated) format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} _static/recomb_rates.tsv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This describes recombination rates across a 100Mb genome with higher rates on the ends\n",
    "(for instance, 3.2 and 2.8 cM/Mb in the first and last 15Mb respectively)\n",
    "and lower rates in the middle (0.25 cM/Mb between 50Mb and 85Mb).\n",
    "The first column gives the starting position, in bp,\n",
    "for the window whose recombination rate is given in the second column.\n",
    "(*Note:* this is *not* a standard format for recombination maps -\n",
    "it is more usual for the *starting* position to be listed!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is SLiM code to read this file and set the recombination rates:\n",
